#I chose chatgpt 4.0-mini mostly becuase of costs. If the user is satisfied with the answer that 4.0 mini provided then they would hopefully not use the larger model. There is a chance however that some people would run both anyway so that would be something that would require further market research to see how users interact with the app.
